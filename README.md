# Hey there, I'm Ken Lengel II.

I combine my technical knowledge with a deep interest in theology and Christian ministry, exploring how these disciplines intersect to support educational excellence and ministry effectiveness.

My journey includes a commitment to integrating technology with ministry, empowering educators and church leaders alike. As your partner, I’ll help you at the intersection of faith, technology, and community impact.

## Alright, who can I help?

### Churches & Christian Schools

I currently serve in a church and Christian school, so I understand the daily challenges these ministries face. I’d love to help you leverage technology to enhance your ministry and educational efforts.

### Mission Agencies & Non-Profits

I know that there are ministries outside of the church context that need technological assistance. I’m eager to offer my help in any way possible. These organizations face unique challenges that require innovative solutions, and I’m ready to provide my support.

### Church Planting Initiatives

I am passionate about supporting missionaries and church planters both locally and globally. I’d love to assist those fulfilling the Great Commission by helping them utilize technology to expand their reach.
