# Hey there, I'm Ken Lengel II.

I combine my technical knowledge with a deep interest in theology and Christian ministry, exploring how these disciplines intersect to support educational excellence and ministry effectiveness.

My goal is to help your ministry at the intersection of faith, technology, and community impact.
